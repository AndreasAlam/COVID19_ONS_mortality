## Data source

This project uses publically available data that can be downloaded from the [ONS website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales). The data were released with an [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). 


## How does it work?

What you need to do to reproduce the analysis or re-use the code on your local machine.  

### Requirements

Software or packages that needs to be installed and and how to install them.

For example:
These scripts were written under R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29) -- "Holding the windsock" and RStudio Version 1.2.5033. 
The following R packages (available on CRAN) are needed: 
* [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (1.3.0)
* [**here**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html) (0.1)
* **THFstyle** internal package
Functions from internal package, theme_THF() and scale_XXX_THF() can be removed or be replaced with eg theme_minimal().


### Getting started

Describe the way in which the code can be used.
